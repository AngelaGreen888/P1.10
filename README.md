### How far did we go with the implementation

### The plan moving forward:

Now that sketches are done and we know what features we want to include in our project, now we will be creating a p5.js file within this GitHub project. This will allow for collaboration among the group as we will make a separate branch for testing. By using pull requests we will be able to check each other's work and merge when we feel that the improvements are of good quality.
